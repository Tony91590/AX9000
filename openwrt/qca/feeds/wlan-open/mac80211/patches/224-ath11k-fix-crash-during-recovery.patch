Subject: [PATCH] ath11k: Fix crash during FW recovery on reo cmd ring access

In scenarios when a peer is disassociating, there could be multiple
places where a REO cmd ring is accessed, such as during
aggregation teardown, tid queue cleanup etc.

When this happens during FW recovery where accessing of FW/HW resources/registers
is not recommended, accessing reo cmd ring in this case could lead to
crash or undefined behaviour.

Hence avoid this by checking for corresponding flag to avoid
accessing REO CMD ring during FW recovery.
